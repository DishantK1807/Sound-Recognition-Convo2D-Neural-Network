# Sound Recognition
## Using Neural Networks

### Summary

The main goal this project is to recognize *(fingerprint)* short audio samples, such as short speech command, whistle, 
or any other sound from nature and map them to specific action.

### Motivation

Using sound samples for reaching your goal:

    - Sound recognition of songs *(music)* , sounds from nature, human voice
    - Using human voice for commanding smarthpone, smart vehicle during the ride
    - Can be of great use to people with major disorder
